## New Interfaces for Jewish Texts

Sefaria is creating interfaces, apps (like a source sheet builder) and infrastructure (like an API and a structured dataset) for Jewish texts and textual learning. Our website is up at www.sefaria.org.

You can find outputs of our entire database in [Sefaria-Export](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export).

Interested developers should join the [sefara-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sefaria-dev).

For general discussion about the project, please post to the [Sefaria Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sefaria).

You can post bugs or request/discuss features on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blockspeiser/Sefaria-Project/issues?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=open). Tackling an issue marked as a "Starter Project" is a good way to sink your teeth into Sefaria.

If you're interested in working on a project you see listed here, please email the [sefara-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sefaria-dev).

### Getting Started

#### Install Python
Most UNIX systems come with a python interpreter pre-installed. 
##### For Windows:

Go to the [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6) and download and install python.
Add the python directory to your OS' PATH variable. See [here](https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html)

#### (Optional) Install virtualenv:
If you work on many Python projects, you may want to keep Sefaria's python installation separate using Virtualenv.  If you're happy having Sefaria requirements in your main Python installation, skip this step.

Install [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) then enter these commands:

    virtualenv venv --distribute
    source venv/bin/activate

Now you should see `(venv)` in front of your command prompt. The second command sets your shell to use the Python virtual environment that you've just created. This is something that you have to run everytime you open a new shell and want to run the Sefaria demo. You can always tell if you're in the virtual environment by checking if `(venv)` is at the beginning of your command prompt. 
    
#### Pip: 
If you don't already have it in your Python installation, install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Then use it to install the required Python packages.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are not using virtualenv, run it with sudo: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you see an error about a missing 'python.h' file, you'll need to install the Python development libraries. 

On Debian systems: 

    sudo apt-get install python-dev

On Fedora systems:

    sudo dnf install python2-devel

After installing the Python development libraries, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

On Windows systems, use instructions [here](http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/) and then make sure that the scripts sub folder of the python installation directory is also in PATH.

#### Install gettext

gettext is a GNU utility that Django uses to manage localizations. 

On Mac:

    brew install gettext

On Debian systems

    sudo apt-get install gettext

#### Create a local settings file:

    cd sefaria
    cp local_settings_example.py local_settings.py
    vim local_settings.py
    
Replace the placeholder values with values with those matching your environment. You can name your local database (`sefaria` will be the default created by `mongorestore` below). You can leave `SEFARIA_DB_USER` ad `SEFARIA_DB_PASSWORD` blank if you don't need to run authentication on Mongo.

#### Create a log directory:
Create a directory called "log" under the project folder. Make sure that the server user has write access to it by using a command such as chmod 777.

#### Get Mongo running:

If you don't already have it, [install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/). Our current data dump requires MongoDB version 2.6 or later. After installing Mongo, run the mongo daemon with:

    sudo mongod

#### Put some texts in your database:

A MongoDB dump of our database is available at http://dev.sefaria.org/static/dump.tar.gz . Download and unzip this content, then from the parent directory which contains `dump` run:

    mongorestore --drop

This will create (or overwrite) a mongo database called `sefaria`.

#### Set up Django's local server
`manage.py` is used to run and to manage the local server.  It is located in the root directory of the `Sefaria-Project` code base. 

Django auth features run on a separate database. To init this database and set up Django's auth system, switch to the root directory of the `Sefaria-Project` code base, and run: 

    python manage.py syncdb
    
#### Run the development server:

    python manage.py runserver

You can also make it publicly available by specifying 0.0.0.0 for the host:

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

#### Get Node:

Node is now required to run the site because we are using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle our javascript. To install node and npm, see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). On Debian systems you can do:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo apt-get install npm

Now download the required Javascript libraries and install some global tools for development with the `setup` script.

    npm install
    sudo npm run setup

Create a local settings file for node and tell it what port to run on and where to find the Django server. The port should match the `NODE_HOST` variable set in Django's `local_settings.py`.

    cp node/local_settings_example.json node/local_settings.json
    vim node/local_settings.json
    
#### Run Webpack

To get the site running, you need to bundle the javascript with Webpack. Run:

    npm run build-client
    
to bundle once. To watch the javascript for changes and automatically rebuild, run:

    npm run watch-client

    
#### Server-side rendering with Node:

Sefaria uses React.js. To render HTML server-side, we use a Node.js server. For development, the site is fully functional without server-side rendering. For deploying in a production environemnet however server side HTML is very important for bots and SEO. 

For development, you can run the Node server using nodemon with:

    npm start
    
You also need to set 

    USE_NODE = True
    
in Django's `local_settings.py`. To run webpack with server-side rendering, use:

    npm run build
    
or

    npm run watch

## Command Line Interface

The shell script `cli` will invoke a python interpreter with the core models loaded, and can be used as a standalone interface to texts or for testing.

    $ ./cli
    >>> p = LinkSet(Ref("Genesis 13"))
    >>> p.count()
    226
