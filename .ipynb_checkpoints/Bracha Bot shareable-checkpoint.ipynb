Let's say we have a friend named Avigayil, and Avigayil's favorite flavor ice cream is Mint Chocolate Chip. Now, if there's no mint, then she'll have anything with chocolate, but **ideally** she likes Mint Chocolate Chip. \n",

However, we often come across a middle gray category where things are okay, but not ideal.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a chart of the food-types and the brachot **this** Mishnah correlates with them. Using your prior knowledge, are these the typical brachot we make on each of these food-types? Explain for each food-type. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does \"יצא\" mean in this context? Does it seem to be לכתחילה or בדיעבד?\n",
