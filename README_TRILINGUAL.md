# Sefaria Trilingual Display - EXPERIMENTAL

⚠️ **Status: NOT YET ALPHA - NOT WORKING YET**

This is an experimental implementation of a trilingual Hebrew-Transliteration-English display system for Sefaria texts.

## Current Status: Pre-Alpha Development

**🚨 WARNING: This implementation is in early development and should NOT be used in production.**

### What's Working ✅
- [x] Hebrew-Transliteration 1:1 word correspondence
- [x] Line balance algorithm (Hebrew/transliteration and English have equal line counts)
- [x] Proportional column sizing to minimize white space
- [x] Sefaria API integration with fallback mechanism
- [x] Print layout (Hebrew+Transliteration on left pages, English on right pages)
- [x] Multiple transliteration schema support

### Critical Issues That Need Fixing 🔧

#### High Priority Issues
1. **Column Width Algorithm Needs Refinement** 
   - Current proportional sizing works but needs fine-tuning
   - Edge cases with very long/short verses need handling
   - Responsive behavior across different viewport sizes needs improvement

2. **Performance Optimization Required**
   - Word-packing algorithm runs multiple calculations per verse
   - Canvas text measurement could be optimized
   - Memory usage with large texts needs analysis

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Only tested on modern Chromium browsers
   - Safari and Firefox compatibility unknown
   - Mobile responsiveness not implemented

#### Medium Priority Issues
4. **Error Handling**
   - API failure scenarios need better UX
   - Network timeout handling incomplete
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

5. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support not implemented
   - Keyboard navigation missing
   - High contrast mode support needed

6. **Integration with Sefaria Core**
   - This is currently a standalone implementation
   - Needs integration with Sefaria's routing system
   - User preferences and settings integration required

### How to Test
1. Open `authentic_sefaria_demo.html` in a modern browser
2. The page will attempt to fetch from local Sefaria API
3. Falls back to hardcoded Genesis Chapter 1 verses if API unavailable

### Contributing
This experimental feature is not ready for community contributions yet. Please wait for Alpha release.

### Timeline
- **Pre-Alpha** (Current): Core functionality development
- **Alpha** (Target: TBD): Basic functionality stable, ready for limited testing
- **Beta** (Target: TBD): Integration with Sefaria core, community feedback
- **Production** (Target: TBD): Full release after comprehensive testing
