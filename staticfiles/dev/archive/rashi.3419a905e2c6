	<span class="anchorText">In the beginning</span>
	Rabbi Yitzchak said: [God] could have begun the Torah only from "This month shall be to you" (Exodus 12:2), which is the first mitzvah (precept) which Israel was commanded. So what is the reason that [God] began with "In the beginning"? Because of [the idea expressed in the verse]: "[God] has declared to His people the power of His works, in order to give them the heritage of the nations" (Psalm 111:6). Thus, should the nations of the world say to Israel: "You are robbers, having conquered the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations [by force]," [Israel] can say to them: "The whole earth belongs to the Holy Blessed One; He created it and gave it to whomever He saw fit. By His will He gave it to [the Canaanite seven nations], and by His will He took it from them and gave it to us."

<span class="commentary" data-ref="1:1">
	<span class="commentator">Rashi:</span>
	<span class="anchorText">In the beginning, [God] created (B'reshit bara)</span>
	This verse surely calls out, "Interpret me Midrashically!" As our teachers of blessed memory interpreted it: [God created the world] for the sake of the Torah which is called "the beginning (reshit) of [God's] way" (Proverbs 8:22), and for Israel who were called "the beginning (reshit) of [God's] grain" (Jeremiah 2:3).
However, if you wish to interpret it literally, then interpret it thus: In the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth, when the earth was unformed and void and darkness, God said "Let there be light". The verse does not come to teach the order of creation – to say that these things [heaven and earth] were [created] first – because if this had been what it came to teach, it would have said "First (barishonah) [God] created the heavens," etc. [We cannot understand B'reshit to mean in the beginning], since there is no [instance of] reshit in scripture that is not closely connected to the word after it, e.g.: "In the beginning of Yehoyakim's reign" (Jeremiah 26:1); "the beginning of his kingdom" (Genesis 10:10); "the first fruit [reshit] of your grain" (Deuteronomy 18:4). Likewise here you must interpret B'reshit bara Elohim et hashamayim etc. as if it were written B'reshit b'ro, "In the beginning of [God's] creation of". Similar to it [where the noun in the construct state is followed by a verb rather than a noun] is [the following]: "T'chilat Diber Hashem B'hoshea" (Hosea 1:2), i.e. At the beginning of the Blessed Holy One's speaking to Hosea, God said to Hosea, etc.
But if you say that it comes to teach that these things [heaven and earth] were created first, and that its interpretation is "In the beginning of everything [God] created these" – and indeed you have verses that abridge their language and leave out a word, as in "For it did not close the doors of my womb" (Job 3:10), where it does not specify who is the closer; and as in "... will carry away the riches of Damascus" (Isaiah 8:4), without specifying who will carry it; and as in "If one will plow with cattle" (Amos 6:12), where it does not specify "if a person will plow with cattle"; and as in "Declaring the end from the beginning..." (Isaiah 46:10), where it does not specify "Declaring from the beginning of a thing the end of a thing" – if so, [that the heaven and earth were created first], you must question yourself, because it is written, "And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water" (Genesis 1:2), even though the verse had not yet revealed when the creation of water happened. Thus you have learned that the water preceded the earth.
Furthermore, heaven was created from fire and water. So you must admit that the verse does not teach the order of earlier and later [acts of Creation] at all.

	And it does not say "Hashem created" [i.e., the Torah refers to the Creator by the name Elohim, signifying strict justice, rather than by the Ineffable 4-letter Name, signifying mercy], because initially [God] thought to create [the world] with the attribute of strict justice. But [God] saw that the world would not last [if governed only with strict justice], so He had the attribute of mercy precede and partner with the attribute of strict justice, and so it is written: "In the day that Hashem God created earth and heaven" (Genesis 2:4) [i.e., the name denoting mercy preceding the one denoting strict justice].

	According to the sequence of the language of the chapter, it should have been written, “the first day,” as it is written regarding the other days, “second, third, fourth.” Why did Scripture write“one” ? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, was the only one in His world, for the angels were not created until the second day.

	Let the expanse be strengthened, for, although the heavens were created on the first day, they were still moist, and they solidified on the second [day] from the rebuke of the Holy One, blessed be He, when He said, “Let there be an expanse.” This is what Scripture says (Job 26:11): “The pillars of the heavens trembled” the entire first day, and on the second day: “They were astonished by His rebuke,” like a person who stands in astonishment because of the rebuke of the one who frightens him.

Ramban , however quotes the Genesis Rabbah , which states that the original primordial light served only during the first three days, until the sun and the moon were suspended in the sky. After that, the primordial light was hidden away, as in Rashi to verse 4. Note also that several early manuscripts and printed editions of Rashi read: “but in the seven days of Creation, the primordial light and darkness served, this one by day and this one by night.” This is also the reading of Mizrachi , and it appears more accurate than our reading, because, in fact, the light and the darkness did not serve together, as Rashi explains in verse 4.]

But rather, [the passage means that] these [angels] were standing on the right to defend, and these [angels] were standing on the left to prosecute. Likewise, (Dan. 4:14): “By the decree of the destructive angels is the matter, and by the word of the holy ones is the edict.” Here too, He took counsel with His heavenly household.

	And to all the beasts of the earth: He equated cattle and the beasts to them [to man] regarding the food [that they were permitted to eat]. He did not permit Adam and his wife to kill a creature and to eat its flesh; only every green herb they were all permitted to eat equally. When the sons of Noah came, He permitted them to eat flesh, as it is said (below 9:3): “Every creeping thing that is alive, etc.” Like the green herbs, which I permitted to the first man, I have given you everything. — [from Sanh. 59b]

	<span class="anchorText">the sixth day</span>
	Scripture added a “hey” on the sixth [day], at the completion of the Creation, to tell us that He stipulated with them, [“you were created] on the condition that Israel accept the Five Books of the Torah.” [The numerical value of the “hey” is five.] (Tanchuma Bereishith 1). Another explanation for “the sixth day” : They [the works of creation] were all suspended until the “sixth day,” referring to the sixth day of Sivan, which was prepared for the giving of the Torah (Shab. 88a). [The“hey” is the definite article, alluding to the well-known sixth day, the sixth day of Sivan, when the Torah was given (ad loc.).]

	<span class="anchorText">And God saw all that He had made, and found it very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.</span>
	Rabbi Nahman said in Rabbi Samuel's name: "Behold, it was good" refers to the Good Desire; "And behold, it was very good" refers to the Evil Desire. (It only says "very good" after man was created with both the good and bad inclinations, in all other cases it only says "and God saw that it was good") Can then the Evil Desire be very good? That would be extraordinary! But without the Evil Desire, however, no man would build a house, take a wife and beget children; and thus said Solomon: "Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour." (Kohelet IV, 4) (Genesis Rabbah 9:7, translation from Soncino Publications).
