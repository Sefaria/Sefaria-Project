<div class="chapter">
	<span class="verse">In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</span>
	<span class="verse">And the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the abyss, God's spirit was drifting over the surface of the water.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said "let there be light" and light was.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God saw this light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.</span> 		
	<span class="verse">And God called the light day, and called the darkness night; And it was evening, and it was morning, day one.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, "A expanse will be inside the waters, and it will make a divide between water and water".</span>
	<span class="verse">And God made the expanse, and divided the water which was under the expanse from the water which was above the expanse; and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God called the expanse "sky". And it was evening and it was morning, day two.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, "the waters below the sky will drain to one place, and the dry land will show"; and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God called the dry land land, and the pool of water he called seas. And God saw it was good.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, engrassed will be the Earth with grass plants sowing seeds, fruit trees making fruit of its kind, with its seed inside, on the Earth, and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And the land sprouted seeded grasses, plants sowing seeds, of their kind, and trees making fruit with their seed inside; and God saw it was good.</span>
	<span class="verse">And it was evening and it was morning, day three.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, there will be lights in the expanse of the sky, to distinguish between the night and the day; and they will be for signs and for seasons, for days, and years.</span>
	<span class="verse">And it was for the lights in the expanse of the sky to light up the Earth, and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God made, the two great lights: the big light, to govern the day, and the small light to govern the night, and the stars.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God gave them, in the expanse of the sky, to light up the Earth.</span>
	<span class="verse">And to govern, the day and night, and to separate between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good.</span>
	<span class="verse">And it was evening, and it was morning, day four.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, the waters will infest with forms of living spirit; and fowl will fly above the land, on the surface of the expanse of the sky.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God created the big crocodiles, and all the living beings that roam, which teemed the water with their own kind, and every bird of a feather to its kind, and God saw that it was good.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God blessed them, saying: "Bear fruit and multiply, and fill the water in the seas and the bird, will multiply on the land."</span>
	<span class="verse">and it was evening and it was morning, day five.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, out of the land will come out living beings of their kind, beasts and crawlers, and land animals, to their kind; and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God made the land animal into its kind, and the beast to its own kind, and the crawler of the land to its own kind; and God saw that it was good.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, we will make man in our image, in our likeness. And they will oversee the fish of the sea and the bird in the sky, and the beast, and all the Earth, and all the crawlers that crawl upon the Earth.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God created the man in his image, in the image of God created him: male and female, created them.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God blessed them, and God told them "bear fruit and multiply and fill up the Earth, and conquer it, and oversee the fish in the sea, and the bird in the sky, and every animal which crawls upon the Earth."</span>
	<span class="verse">And God said, "here I gave to you every seeding plant over all the Earth, and every tree which has a tree fruit, which seeds its seed: for you, for eating.</span>
	<span class="verse">And to every land animal, and to every flying bird, and every animal crawling on the land which has within it a living spirit, and every green plant, for eating," and it was so.</span>
	<span class="verse">And God saw everything which he had done, lo, it is very good. And it was evening, and it was morning, day six.</span>
