23/09/09
1. Initial Version. The version number 0.103 was choosen to keep it same
   as the David-YG fonts.
   The font includes Oblique, Bold and BoldOblique weights of the 
   font.
2. The Cantillation Mark Layout logic (Copyright (c) 2003 & 2007, Ralph Hancock
   & John Hudson.) is the same as in the David-YG fonts and should properely
   position both vowels and "Taamim" in most cases.
3. The Bold versions of the font will not display the cantillation marks
   (not enough place above and under letters) but existance of the marks
   in the text will not cause any disorder. The text will be displayed with
   the vowel marks (and meteg) properely positioned.
