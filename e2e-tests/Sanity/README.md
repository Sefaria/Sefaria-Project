# Sanity — Release-gate E2E Tests

The **release-gate smoke suite**. These tests validate the core user-facing workflows and cross-module integration that must work before every release — authentication state, navigation, profile/settings, the full sheet lifecycle, search, and URL redirects across the Library and Voices modules. A failing Sanity test is a blocking issue.

Runs under the `chrome-sanity` / `firefox-sanity` / `safari-sanity` projects (`baseURL` = `www.<sandbox-domain>`). New here? Read the root [handbook](../README.md) first — it covers setup, the PageManager pattern, and the conventions these specs follow.

## 1. What it covers

| Spec file | IDs | Area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [cross-module-login.spec.ts](cross-module-login.spec.ts) | Scenarios 1–9 | Auth-state persistence across Library ↔ Voices: login, module-switch, multi-tab concurrent-session handling, cross-module deep links. |
| [user-flow-sanity.spec.ts](user-flow-sanity.spec.ts) | Sanity 1–7 | Core user workflows: login, view profile, edit profile, edit account settings, change language, module switcher, logout. |
| [sheet-workflow-sanity.spec.ts](sheet-workflow-sanity.spec.ts) | Sanity 8a–8j | Full sheet lifecycle (serial): create → title → add source/image/YouTube/reader-source → publish → unpublish → add to collection → delete. |
| [search-sanity.spec.ts](search-sanity.spec.ts) | Sanity 9a–9f | Search across both modules: suggestion click-through, results submission, dropdown section/icon validation (module-specific). |
| [cross-module-redirects.spec.ts](cross-module-redirects.spec.ts) | 4 suites | Library→Voices URL redirects, query-param preservation, 301 status codes, no-redirect-loop on Voices. |
| [../Misc/help-sheet-redirects.spec.ts](../Misc/help-sheet-redirects.spec.ts) | data-driven | Legacy help-sheet URLs → Zendesk (EN + HE). **Runs under the `*-misc` projects**, documented here for completeness. |

## 2. Per-spec detail

### cross-module-login.spec.ts — Scenarios 1–9

| # | Scenario | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login on Library, stay on Library | Login works; user stays on Library; profile pic + logout in user menu. |
| 2 | Login on Library → switch to Voices | Auth transfers Library→Voices via module switcher; logged-in UI on Voices. |
| 3 | Login on Voices → switch to Library | Reverse direction; bidirectional auth persistence. |
| 4 | Two Library tabs, login on 2nd | Concurrent-session handling; "You are already logged in as" error. |
| 5 | Two Voices tabs, login on 2nd | Same, on Voices. |
| 6 | Login on Library, then login on open Voices tab | Cross-module session detection prevents duplicate login. |
| 7 | Login on Voices, then login on open Library tab | Reverse cross-module session detection. |
| 8 | Logged-in Library user opens a sheet link in Voices | Auth persists on external→Voices deep link. |
| 9 | Logged-in Voices user opens a text link in Library | Auth persists on external→Library deep link. |

> ⚠️ **Tripwire:** Scenarios 4–7 perform parallel UI logins as the same QA user. They pass only because Sefaria's Django config doesn't regenerate sibling sessions on fresh login; if that policy tightens upstream, these become the next flake (flagged at the top of the spec, and in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) rule 21).

### user-flow-sanity.spec.ts — Sanity 1–7

| ID | Test | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sanity 1 | Login | End-to-end UI login (open menu → login → credentials); profile pic appears; redirected back to origin. |
| Sanity 2 | View profile | Profile via the **Voices** user menu (Profile only exists on Voices); name/position/org/bio/image; edit button on own profile. |
| Sanity 3 | Edit profile | Edit position/org/location on Voices; save persists to profile page. |
| Sanity 4 | Edit account settings | Account Settings via **Library** (Library-only); email shown; toggle notifications/reading-history/customs; save-success dialog. |
| Sanity 5 | Change language | EN↔HE toggle; `body` class + UI text update; round-trips back. |
| Sanity 6 | Module switcher | Reaches Voices, Developers (external), More-from-Sefaria products, and back to Library — each in a new tab with the correct URL. |
| Sanity 7 | Logout | UI logout terminates the session; logged-out UI (profile pic gone, user icon shown). **Uses `BROWSER_SETTINGS.enAdmin` — see the destructive-auth gotcha in §5.** |

### sheet-workflow-sanity.spec.ts — Sanity 8a–8j (serial)

Runs `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` with **shared state**: 8a creates one sheet that 8b–8j operate on.

| ID | Step | ID | Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8a | Login + create sheet (Voices Create button; unique ID) | 8f | Add source from the Library reader's connections panel |
| 8b | Give the sheet a title (auto-save via content) | 8g | Publish with title/description/tags; Unpublish appears |
| 8c | Add source via text lookup (e.g. "Genesis 1:1") | 8h | Unpublish; Publish button reappears |
| 8d | Add an image (file upload) | 8i | Add to a new collection (unique name) |
| 8e | Add a YouTube video (embed) | 8j | Delete the sheet; redirect to profile; gone from list |

### search-sanity.spec.ts — Sanity 9a–9f

| ID | Test | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9a | Library — suggestion click-through | Type a term (e.g. "abraham"), click a topic suggestion, land on the topic page. |
| 9b | Library — submit search | Press Enter (e.g. "avraham"); results page with the query param; results visible. |
| 9c | Library — dropdown sections/icons | Present: Authors/Topics/Categories/Books; **absent: Users**; correct icons. Term "mid" triggers all four. |
| 9d | Voices — suggestion click-through | Type (e.g. "rashi"), click a suggestion, land on topic/profile. |
| 9e | Voices — submit search | Press Enter (e.g. "shabbat"); Voices results page; may include sheets/topics/users. |
| 9f | Voices — dropdown sections/icons | Present: Topics/Authors/Users; **absent: Categories/Books**; correct icons. Term "rashi" triggers all three. |

### cross-module-redirects.spec.ts — 4 suites

- **Suite 1 — Library→Voices redirects:** `/settings/profile`, `/community`, `/collections` (+ specific collection), `/profile` (+ specific user), `/sheets` (+ specific sheet ID) each redirect to the Voices equivalent with no 404/5xx and path preserved.
- **Suite 2 — Query-param preservation:** redirects keep `?tab=…&test=…` and `?sort=recent`.
- **Suite 3 — 301 status:** `/settings/profile` and `/community` return permanent 301s.
- **Suite 4 — No loops on Voices:** direct Voices URLs don't redirect; `settings/account` correctly 404s on Voices (Library-only feature).

### ../Misc/help-sheet-redirects.spec.ts

Two describes (English + Hebrew), each **data-driven from [../helpDeskLinksConstants.ts](../helpDeskLinksConstants.ts)** — every legacy `/sheets/*` link must 301 to its exact `help.sefaria.org/hc/...` article with no error status. Runs under `*-misc`. (See [../Misc/README.md](../Misc/README.md).)

## 4. Architecture

- **Module-specific UI:** the **Profile** menu exists only on Voices; **Account Settings** only on Library. Tests navigate to the right module before touching module-specific features.
- **Auth strategy:** anonymous-start tests (Sanity 1 UI login, the multi-tab cross-module scenarios) enter via `goToPageWithLang(...)` so they can drive the real login form; logged-in-start tests use `goToPageWithUser(...)`, which reads the read-only storage state [global-setup.ts](../global-setup.ts) writes once at run start (no per-test login, no worker race).
- **Isolation:** most tests are independent (fresh context per test). The one exception is `sheet-workflow-sanity.spec.ts`, which is **serial with shared sheet state** (8a → 8j).
- **Page objects / constants:** all interaction goes through `PageManager`; URLs/selectors/data come from `constants.ts` and `globals.ts`.

---

## 5. Gotchas & maintenance notes

- ⚠️ **Sanity 7 (logout) must use `BROWSER_SETTINGS.enAdmin`, not `enUser`.** A UI logout destroys the server-side Django session row, which would invalidate the shared `auth_*.json` for every concurrent worker reading it. `enAdmin` is the de-facto destructive-auth throwaway — no other Sanity test depends on the admin session staying alive. This was a real flake (Sanity 8h/8i intermittently failed with "User Logged out" pills until Sanity 7 was moved off `enUser`). Any **new** destructive-auth test must use a profile no other concurrent test reads, or intercept the destructive request. Full treatment: root handbook [Destructive-auth tests](../README.md#destructive-auth-tests) and [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) rule 21.
- **Language switch (Sanity 5)** uses a cookie fallback + page reload to dodge Strict Mode locator warnings.
- **Profile edit (Sanity 3)** includes a workaround to clear modularization popups that can block the save button.
- **Sheet workflow (8a–8j)** uses keyboard-navigation workarounds for the plus-button positioning issue, and relies on auto-save triggered by content addition.
- **Test data:** `testUser` (QA Automation account) from `globals.ts`; the sheet-workflow suite creates a unique timestamped sheet and collection each run.

## 6. Adding a Sanity test

1. Decide it's genuinely **release-gate** material — a core workflow or cross-module invariant. Narrow feature coverage belongs in a module folder or a `Full testing by Feature/` suite, not here.
2. Give it the next `Sanity N` (or `Scenario N`) label in the relevant spec.
3. If it **destroys or rotates a session** (logout, re-login of a globalSetup profile, password change), read §5 first — use `enAdmin` or intercept the request.
4. Keep it independent unless it genuinely needs shared state (then opt into `serial`, like the sheet workflow).
