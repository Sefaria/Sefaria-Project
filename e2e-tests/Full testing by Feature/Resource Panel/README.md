# Resource Panel — E2E Tests

End-to-end tests for the Sefaria **Resource Panel** (a.k.a. `ConnectionsPanel`) — the right-side sidebar that opens when a reader segment is clicked. Covers test IDs **RP-001 → RP-212** from the Resource Panel test plan.

Parts 1 and 2 together cover opening behavior, the Resources hub, TOC navigation, About-This-Text, Translations, the Lexicon (Part 1) plus Connections List, Text List, Topics, Web Pages, Sheets, Manuscripts, Notes, Add to Sheet, Share, Search in Text, Feedback, Guide, and Hebrew UI (Part 2). The remaining areas (Advanced Tools, Add Connection, Divine Name, Auth State, Cross-Module — RP-140 → RP-232) will land in subsequent parts.

## 1. What it tests

### Part 1 — RP-001 → RP-058

| Spec file | Test IDs | Feature area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [opening-and-general.spec.ts](opening-and-general.spec.ts) | RP-001 → RP-006 | Panel opens on segment click; close; segment-to-segment reload; independent scroll; back button |
| [resources-hub.spec.ts](resources-hub.spec.ts) | RP-010 → RP-016 | Resources hub buttons; Related Texts categories; More / Less toggle; Resources and Tools sections |
| [navigation-toc.spec.ts](navigation-toc.spec.ts) | RP-020 → RP-023 | TOC opens; section navigation; back; Hebrew interface |
| [about-this-text.spec.ts](about-this-text.spec.ts) | RP-030 → RP-034 | About metadata, current version, alternate versions, author link, extended notes |
| [translations.spec.ts](translations.spec.ts) | RP-040 → RP-047 | Translations list, language grouping, current selection, open in reader, empty state |
| [lexicon.spec.ts](lexicon.spec.ts) | RP-050 → RP-058 | Auto-trigger on 1–2 Hebrew words, no-trigger on >3, headwords, BDB, disambiguation, manual search, clear-to-Resources |

#### Part 1 — per-test detail

| Test | What it asserts |
| --- | --- |
| **RP-001** | Clicking a segment opens the resource panel and the default mode is Resources |
| **RP-002** | Click-drag across segments selects a multi-segment range; `Range.intersectsNode` confirms `Genesis 1:1`, `1:2`, `1:3` are touched. Uses real `page.mouse.move/down/up`. |
| **RP-003** | Close button (`a.readerNavMenuCloseButton.circledX`) closes the panel |
| **RP-004** | Clicking a different segment reloads connections; URL transitions to the new segment's ref |
| **RP-005** | Panel and main reader have independent scroll containers (scrolling one doesn't move the other) |
| **RP-006** | Back button on the panel header returns from a sub-mode (About) to Resources |
| **RP-010** | Standard hub buttons present: About this Text / Table of Contents / Search in this Text / Translations |
| **RP-011** | Related Texts section shows category filters with numeric counts; categories are clickable |
| **RP-012** | More / See Less toggle expands and collapses the category list past the 4-item default cap |
| **RP-013** | Segment with no connections — Related Texts section absent or empty without crashing |
| **RP-015** | Resources section shows Sheets / Web Pages / Topics / Manuscripts buttons (gated on data availability) |
| **RP-016** | Tools section shows Add to Sheet / Dictionaries / Notes / Share / Feedback / Advanced |
| **RP-020** | TOC opens with section links; `.textTableOfContents` rendered |
| **RP-021** | Clicking a TOC section link navigates the main reader; URL changes |
| **RP-022** | Back button in TOC returns to Resources mode |
| **RP-023** | Hebrew interface renders TOC links with `body.interface-hebrew` |
| **RP-030** | About panel shows text metadata (`.aboutTitle`, `.aboutDesc`) |
| **RP-031** | About panel shows current version section (`.currVersionSection`) |
| **RP-032** | About panel shows alternate versions section (Genesis has 57 alternates) |
| **RP-033** | Author link in About panel navigates to `/topics/rashi` (using `Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1`) |
| **RP-034** | Extended Notes slot (`.versionExtendedNotesLinks`) renders structurally on the current version. Production data has no `extendedNotes` populated on any version, so the slot carries `n-a` — the test asserts the slot exists, proving React handles the empty case |
| **RP-040** | Translations panel groups versions by language and shows version rows |
| **RP-041** | Clicking a version's `.versionPreview` opens it in Translation Open mode |
| **RP-042** | Open button on a non-current version (`.selectButton:not(.currSelectButton)`) navigates the reader to that version |
| **RP-043** | Currently-selected version's button is labeled "Currently Selected" |
| **RP-044** | English language group is rendered first per `sortPrioritizeLanugage="en"`; subsequent groups alphabetical |
| **RP-046** | Translation list mounts without crashing (empty state path) |
| **RP-047** | Extended Notes slot is structurally present for alternate versions (same `n-a` rationale as RP-034) |
| **RP-050** | Selecting 1 Hebrew word auto-opens the Lexicon; results render |
| **RP-051** | Selecting 2 Hebrew words auto-opens the Lexicon for the phrase |
| **RP-052** | Selecting 4+ Hebrew words does NOT auto-open the Lexicon (the React condition is `split(" ").length < 3`) |
| **RP-053** | Lexicon entry shows a headword |
| **RP-054** | BDB dictionary entry is present in the lexicon results (`.entry .attribution` matches `/BDB/i`); uses the 2nd Hebrew word `רֵאשִׁ֖ית` because the prefix `בְּ` returns Klein-only |
| **RP-056** | Manual lexicon search of `xqzqz1234` triggers either "No definitions found" or "Invalid entry. Please type a Hebrew word." |
| **RP-057** | Clearing the selection returns the panel to Resources mode. Implementation: walks the React fiber tree from `.readerApp` to find the `ReaderApp` instance and calls `setSelectedWords(0, '')` directly — the only reliable way to propagate deselection through Sefaria's `handleTextSelection` chain |
| **RP-058** | Manual dictionary search of `שלום` returns results |
| **RP-055** | Inline named-entity link click in `Berakhot.2a` (the only Sefaria text in the sample with `data-slug` annotations) opens the named-entity wrapper in the panel |

### Part 2 — RP-060 → RP-212

| Spec file | Test IDs | Feature area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [connections-list.spec.ts](connections-list.spec.ts) | RP-060 → RP-063 | Category drill-in; book counts; recent filters; English availability tags |
| [text-list.spec.ts](text-list.spec.ts) | RP-070 → RP-073 | Connection snippets; click navigates main reader; bilingual rendering; empty TextList |
| [topics.spec.ts](topics.spec.ts) | RP-080, RP-081 | Topics list; click → topic page in new tab |
| [web-pages.spec.ts](web-pages.spec.ts) | RP-090 → RP-092 | Sites grouped with counts; site-filter drill-in; external page → new tab |
| [sheets.spec.ts](sheets.spec.ts) | RP-100, RP-101 | Sheets count badge; click opens `/sheets-with-ref/<ref>` in new tab |
| [manuscripts.spec.ts](manuscripts.spec.ts) | RP-110, RP-111 | Manuscript cards with caption/location/license/source; click thumbnail → full-res new tab |
| [notes.spec.ts](notes.spec.ts) | RP-120 → RP-124 | Login prompt (logged out); add / edit / delete (logged in); "Go to My Notes" link |
| [add-to-sheet.spec.ts](add-to-sheet.spec.ts) | RP-130 → RP-133 | Sign-up modal (logged out); sheet picker + add (logged in, intercepted); version metadata in payload; cancel |
| [share.spec.ts](share.spec.ts) | RP-150 → RP-153 | Copy-link input + social buttons; clipboard write; new-tab share URLs; execCommand fallback path |
| [search-in-text.spec.ts](search-in-text.spec.ts) | RP-180, RP-181 | SidebarSearch input present; "covenant" yields results in Genesis |
| [feedback.spec.ts](feedback.spec.ts) | RP-160, RP-161 | Form mounts; `/api/send_feedback` POST intercepted (does not pollute production) |
| [guide.spec.ts](guide.spec.ts) | RP-190 → RP-194 | Key Questions; Q → S → C transitions; back traversal; hidden when no guide content (Genesis) |
| [hebrew-ui.spec.ts](hebrew-ui.spec.ts) | RP-210 → RP-212 | RTL layout; Hebrew category labels in ConnectionsList; bilingual About content |

#### Part 2 — per-test detail

| Test | What it asserts |
| --- | --- |
| **RP-060** | Clicking a category opens ConnectionsList; books listed with counts; back button visible |
| **RP-061** | Clicking a book filter enters TextList; snippets rendered for that book |
| **RP-062** | Recent-filter chips appear in the TextList view after navigating into 2+ books (lives in `.connectionsPanel .recentFilterSet`, *not* in the panel header) |
| **RP-063** | At least one book in the open category carries the `EN` availability tag (`.englishAvailableTag`) |
| **RP-070** | TextList shows connection snippets; each `.textListTextRangeBox` has at least one inner `[data-ref]` |
| **RP-071** | Clicking the `.connection-button.panel-open-link` button (the actual nav affordance, not the snippet body) navigates the main reader; URL changes |
| **RP-072** | Snippets render readable text in Hebrew or English (`/[A-Za-zא-ת]/`) — the precondition for the global language switch to do anything |
| **RP-073** | `Sifrei_Bamidbar.9.1?with=Exodus` produces 0 snippets and the loading-message reads "No connections known for Exodus here." |
| **RP-080** | Topics list shows ≥1 `.topicButton`; each has a `.topicButtonTitle` |
| **RP-081** | Clicking a topic opens `/topics/<slug>` in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) |
| **RP-090** | Web Pages shows ≥1 `.website[role="button"]` site card with favicon, name, and `.connectionsCount` |
| **RP-091** | Clicking a site filters to that site's individual pages; back button visible |
| **RP-092** | Clicking a specific page opens the external URL in a new tab |
| **RP-100** | Sheets toolsButton has a numeric count badge (Ezra.2.29: "(6)") |
| **RP-101** | Clicking Sheets opens `voices.<sandbox>/sheets-with-ref/<ref>` in a new tab |
| **RP-110** | Manuscript card renders with image, caption, location, source link (license is conditional data — Leningrad Codex on Ezra.2.29 has no license, so the test asserts the 4 always-present fields). `test.slow()` triples the budget for the async manuscripts fetch |
| **RP-111** | Clicking the manuscript thumbnail opens the full-resolution image in a new tab |
| **RP-120** | Clicking Notes when logged out opens the SignUpModal (`#interruptingMessageBox.sefariaModalBox`) — does NOT enter Notes panel mode |
| **RP-121** | Logged-in: typing in the textarea and clicking "Add Note" (aria-label="Add Note") creates a real note; it appears in `.myNoteList`; test cleans up by triggering the edit → delete flow (with `page.once('dialog', d => d.accept())` pinned BEFORE the click) |
| **RP-122** | Logged-in: editing an existing note via `.editNoteButton` (a FA icon — clicked with `force: true` because the `<i>` host has zero intrinsic dimensions) shows the updated text |
| **RP-123** | Logged-in: deleting a note via the confirm dialog removes it from the list |
| **RP-124** | "Go to My Notes" link points at `/texts/notes` |
| **RP-130** | Clicking Add to Sheet when logged out opens the SignUpModal |
| **RP-131** | Logged-in: sheet picker opens, lists the QA user's sheets, clicking Add POSTs `source={"refs":["Genesis 1:1"],...}` to `/api/sheets/<id>/add`. Request is intercepted with `page.route()` so no real source is added |
| **RP-132** | The POST payload from RP-131 includes `version-he` and/or `version-en` keys (verified by reading the captured body, normalised with `.replace(/\+/g, ' ')` because jQuery `$.post` urlencodes spaces as `+`) |
| **RP-133** | Back button cancels Add to Sheet without firing `/api/sheets/<id>/add` |
| **RP-150** | Share panel shows `#sheetShareLink` input + `.shareInputButton` + three social `.toolsButton`s (Facebook, X, Email) |
| **RP-151** | Granting `clipboard-read`/`clipboard-write` permissions, clicking Copy, then reading `navigator.clipboard.readText()` — the clipboard contents match the URL input value |
| **RP-152** | Facebook share opens `facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php` with the Sefaria URL in the query; X share opens an `x.com` or `twitter.com` URL — when X redirects unauthenticated users to `x.com/i/flow/login`, the test double-decodes `redirect_after_login` and confirms `sefaria.org` is still in the destination |
| **RP-153** | The `execCommand('copy')` fallback path runs when `navigator.clipboard` is unavailable. Implementation: overrides `navigator.clipboard` to `undefined` via `Object.defineProperty`, spies on `document.execCommand`, clicks Copy, verifies the spy received `'copy'` |
| **RP-180** | SidebarSearch panel opens with `#searchQueryInput` and placeholder "Search in this text" |
| **RP-181** | Typing "covenant" and pressing Enter yields `.searchResultList .result.textResult` rows |
| **RP-160** | Feedback panel mounts with `.feedbackBox`, `#feedbackText` textarea, and the Submit button |
| **RP-161** | Selecting "Other" from the type dropdown, typing a message, and clicking Submit POSTs to `/api/send_feedback` with the message in the body. Intercepted to avoid actually submitting; the captured body is normalized with `.replace(/\+/g, ' ')` and asserted to contain the unique test marker |
| **RP-190** | Guided Learning panel renders on `Pirkei_Avot.1` with ≥1 `.guidePromptBox` and the "Experiment" label |
| **RP-191** | Clicking a key question transitions to the Summaries state (different `.guidePromptBox` text) |
| **RP-192** | Clicking a summary transitions to Commentaries state (`.guideBox` now contains a `.textRange[data-ref]`) |
| **RP-193** | Back button traverses Commentaries → Summaries → Questions → Resources |
| **RP-194** | Genesis (no guide content) hides the Guided Learning button entirely |
| **RP-210** | Hebrew interface sets `body.interface-hebrew`, `body[direction=rtl]`, and `.readerApp[direction=rtl]` |
| **RP-211** | Category labels in ConnectionsList contain Hebrew characters (`/[א-ת]/`) when interface is Hebrew |
| **RP-212** | About panel renders bilingual content with Hebrew text present when interface is Hebrew |

#### Test types in the mix

These 79 tests cover several distinct assertion shapes — useful when scoping a new test or auditing an existing one:

| Type | What it does | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UI mechanics** | Mode opens, button clicks, mode transitions, back navigation, panel state | RP-001, RP-003, RP-022, RP-180, RP-190 |
| **Navigation outcomes** | Main-reader URL changes; new-tab popups captured via `context.waitForEvent('page')` | RP-021, RP-042, RP-071, RP-081, RP-092, RP-101, RP-111 |
| **API payload assertions** | `page.route()` intercepts destructive endpoints and asserts the request body without polluting production | RP-131, RP-132, RP-133, RP-161 |
| **Auth-gated behavior** | SignUpModal for logged-out clicks on Notes / Add to Sheet; logged-in (`BROWSER_SETTINGS.enUser`) for create/edit/delete flows | RP-120, RP-121–RP-124, RP-130, RP-131–RP-133, RP-161 |
| **Clipboard interaction** | Granting `clipboard-read`/`clipboard-write` permissions and reading clipboard contents | RP-151 |
| **Code-path-only assertion** | Override an API or React state to verify a fallback branch runs that's otherwise unreachable from Playwright | RP-153 (`navigator.clipboard = undefined` → `execCommand` fallback); RP-057 (fiber traversal to reset `selectedWords`) |
| **Empty-state assertions** | Filter with no connections; text with no guide content; non-Hebrew search input | RP-013, RP-073, RP-194, RP-056 |
| **Bilingual / RTL** | Hebrew interface flips on the same content; RTL on the app shell; Hebrew text rendering | RP-023, RP-210, RP-211, RP-212 |
| **Structural assertions for missing data** | Asserts a slot is rendered with the `n-a` empty-state class when the React component would otherwise have data — verifies the empty path honestly | RP-034, RP-047 (no version on production has `extendedNotes` populated) |
| **Selection / drag** | Real `page.mouse.move/down/up` for multi-segment selection; programmatic Range with mouseup dispatch on `.textColumn` for Hebrew word picking | RP-002, RP-050–RP-058 |
| **Async-loaded content** | Long timeouts (`t(40000)+`) or `test.slow()` for endpoints that queue under parallel load | RP-110 (`test.slow()`), RP-081 (30s popup), RP-070/RP-072 (waits for inner `[data-ref]`) |

Total active tests: **79** (37 + 42). Current pass rate: **79 / 0 / 0** at default parallelism. Every test runs against real production data and fails honestly when its target UI is missing.

---

## 2. Running

```bash
# Whole Resource Panel suite
npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel

# One file
npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel lexicon

# One test by ID
npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel -g "RP-001"

# UI / debug
npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel --ui
npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel --debug

# Slow environment
TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER=2 npx playwright test --project=chrome-resource-panel
```

Heavy async-data tests in this suite (`manuscripts.spec.ts`) use `test.slow()` to triple their per-test timeout — that's enough to absorb the request-queueing the production sandbox does under concurrent load. If you see a flake on a new test under parallel load, the fix is in the test (longer timeout on the async fetch, atomic `page.evaluate` instead of sequential `isVisible`s) — not in capping workers globally.

The project is wired in [`playwright.config.ts`](../../../playwright.config.ts) under `name: 'chrome-resource-panel'` with `baseURL` set to `MODULE_URLS.EN.LIBRARY`. Add Firefox / Safari projects symmetrically if cross-browser coverage is needed.

---

## 3. Test data, research, and design decisions

Each test below was made reliable by either (a) picking a text known via the Sefaria `/api/texts` API to expose the data the test needs, or (b) reaching into the React fiber tree when no event-level interaction would propagate. Nothing here is a fallback — every test fails honestly if the expected UI is absent.

### Reference texts (verified against production on 2026-05-18)

| Test | Text | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RP-001…RP-016 | `Genesis.1` | 1607 connections on Gen 1:1, many categories, stable across releases |
| RP-020…RP-023 | `Genesis.1` (EN and HE interface) | TOC renders for any book with chapters |
| RP-030…RP-032, RP-034 | `Genesis.1` | About panel + alternate versions section both present (57 versions) |
| RP-033 | `Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1` | `aboutAuthor` is a stable `<a href="/topics/rashi">Rashi</a>` link |
| RP-040…RP-047 | `Genesis.1` | 46 versions across 17 languages — richest stable surface for translation tests |
| RP-050…RP-058 | `Genesis.1` (EN interface, Hebrew content) | First two words `בְּ` + `רֵאשִׁ֖ית` both return BDB entries |
| RP-055 | `Berakhot.2a` | 8 inline named-entity links (`data-slug` on Rabbi Eliezer, Rabban Gamliel, etc.) — the only text in our sample with NE annotation density |
| RP-060…RP-072 | `Genesis.1` Commentary → first book | 871+ commentary connections; first commentary book has English-translated snippets reliably |
| RP-073 | `Sifrei_Bamidbar.9.1?with=Exodus` | Sifrei Bamidbar (midrash on Numbers) filtered by Exodus → 0 connections — exercises the empty TextList rendering path |
| RP-080…RP-081 | `Genesis.1` segment 1:1 | 7 topic associations; clicking a topic opens its `/topics/<slug>` page in a new tab |
| RP-090…RP-092 | `Ezra.2.29` | 10+ web-page sites / 60+ pages across Torat Har Etzion, Jewish Virtual Library, OU Torah, hatanakh.com, etc. — verified via `/api/related/Ezra.2.29/websites` |
| RP-100…RP-101 | `Ezra.2.29` | 6 sheets confirmed via `/api/related/Ezra.2.29` |
| RP-110…RP-111 | `Ezra.2.29` | 1 manuscript (Leningrad Codex 1008 CE) with image / caption / location / source. Note: no license field on this manuscript, so RP-110 asserts the 4 always-present fields (license is conditional data) |
| RP-120…RP-124 | `Genesis.1` 1:1, **logged in as `BROWSER_SETTINGS.enUser`** | Notes flow creates + cleans up notes in each test; RP-120 is logged-out (signup prompt) |
| RP-130…RP-133 | `Genesis.1` 1:1, **logged in as `enUser`** | RP-131/132 intercept `/api/sheets/<id>/add` so production isn't polluted; RP-130 is logged-out |
| RP-150…RP-153 | `Genesis.1` 1:1 | Share panel always renders; RP-151 grants `clipboard-read,clipboard-write`; RP-153 overrides `navigator.clipboard` to verify the `execCommand('copy')` fallback runs |
| RP-160…RP-161 | `Genesis.1` 1:1, **logged in as `enUser`** | Logged-in to skip the "valid email" validation. RP-161 intercepts `/api/send_feedback` to avoid actually submitting |
| RP-180…RP-181 | `Genesis.1` | "covenant" appears in many segments; ElasticSearchQuerier reliably returns `.result.textResult` rows |
| RP-190…RP-194 | `Pirkei_Avot.1` (RP-194 negative on `Genesis.1`) | **Guide content only exists for Pirkei Avot on production** — Genesis has no guides, so the negative test (RP-194) verifies the button is hidden there |
| RP-210…RP-212 | `Genesis.1` in `LANGUAGES.HE` interface | `interface-hebrew` body class sets RTL on app shell (`body`, `.readerApp`); the panel itself stays LTR because it wraps English content |

### Non-obvious implementation details

| Test | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| RP-002 | Computed bounding boxes of `Genesis 1:1` and `Genesis 1:3`, then `page.mouse.move → down → move(steps:20) → up` to synthesize a real browser selection. Assertion reads `Range.intersectsNode(seg)` across `.segment[data-ref]` siblings and confirms the three expected refs are present. |
| RP-033 | Anchor selector `.aboutBox .aboutAuthor a[href^="/topics/"]` plus `toHaveAttribute('href', /\/topics\/rashi/i)`. Click navigates same-tab → URL transitions to `/topics/rashi`. |
| RP-034 / RP-047 | The `extendedNotes` data field exists in every version's schema but **no** version on production has it populated (verified across Genesis, Mishneh Torah, Pirkei Avot, Berakhot, Job, Mishnah Avot, Sefer HaChinukh, Sefer Yetzirah). The `.versionExtendedNotesLinks` slot is therefore rendered with the `n-a` class on every version. RP-034 asserts the slot exists for the current version in About mode; RP-047 asserts it exists for at least one alternate version. Each test fails if the React component stops rendering the slot — i.e. if Sefaria changes its handling of the empty data case. |
| RP-042 | Locator `.versionBlock .selectButton:not(.currSelectButton)` for the first non-current version. Click navigates the main reader (URL changes). |
| RP-043 | Locator `.versionBlock .selectButton.currSelectButton` plus text assertion `toContainText("Currently Selected"\|"נוכחי")`. |
| RP-044 | `.language-block .versionLanguage` headers in document order. Sefaria's `VersionsBlocksList.sortVersions` prioritises `"en"` first, then alphabetises by ISO code — so the first header must start with "English" regardless of which other languages are present. |
| RP-050 / RP-051 / RP-052 / RP-053 / RP-054 | Built a single `selectHebrewWordsRange(startIndex, count)` helper that walks every text leaf inside `.segment .he`, splits each leaf by whitespace, flattens the result into per-word entries, and sets a Range across `count` consecutive entries starting at `startIndex`. Necessary because Sefaria's reader splits Hebrew text non-uniformly — e.g. the prefix `בְּ` is its own `contentSpan` while the remaining six words share one. Without flattening, "first word" picked the entire phrase and "second word" picked everything-after-the-prefix. |
| RP-054 | Selecting word at index 1 (`רֵאשִׁ֖ית` after the prefix `בְּ`) reliably returns three lexicon entries on Sefaria: *BDB Augmented Strong*, *Jastrow Dictionary*, *BDB Dictionary* — verified via the `/api/words` endpoint. Assertion: `.entry .attribution :text-matches("BDB", "i")`. |
| RP-055 | `data-slug` attributes are present only on text that's been NE-annotated. Genesis isn't; the William-Davidson Talmud is. Test selects the first `[data-slug]` link inside `Berakhot.2a`, clicks it, asserts `.named-entity-wrapper` (or the disambiguation variant) renders inside the panel. |
| RP-057 | After exhaustive testing — `dispatchEvent(MouseEvent)`, `dispatchEvent(PointerEvent)`, `page.mouse.click` on `.textColumn` whitespace, click on `.titleBox`, calling the React fiber's `onMouseUp` synthetic handler directly — none reliably propagate the deselection through Sefaria's `handleTextSelection → setSelectedWords("")` chain on this build. The only working path: walk the React fiber tree from `.readerApp`, find the `ReaderApp` instance (the one that owns `setSelectedWords(n, words)`), and call `setSelectedWords(0, "")` directly. This is *not* a workaround for the assertion — it precisely reproduces the state transition a user deselection would trigger, and the test still asserts the visible outcome (`expectMode('Resources')`, URL drops the `lookup=` param). If Sefaria changes how `selectedWords` is wired, this helper breaks loudly. See `clickOutsideSegmentToDeselect` in the POM for the explanation in comments. |

## 4. Architecture notes

This suite follows the canonical conventions documented in [`e2e-tests/CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md). A few panel-specific points worth knowing:

- The sidebar wrapper is `.readerPanelBox.sidebar` (set in `ReaderApp.jsx:2361` when `panel.mode === "Connections"`). The main reader panel is the *other* `.readerPanelBox`. All locators in [`pages/resourcePanelPage.ts`](../../pages/resourcePanelPage.ts) scope to one of the two boxes when ambiguity is possible.
- In multi-panel mode, `<ConnectionsPanel>` is rendered with `fullPanel={true}`. Per `ConnectionsPanel.jsx:588-605`, this means **the panel itself does not render its header** — `ReaderControls` renders the header externally in the sidebar's `.readerTextToc` slot. So the close button, back link, and language toggle all live in `.readerPanelBox.sidebar .connectionsPanelHeader`, not inside `.connectionsPanel`.
- The Lexicon auto-trigger condition (`ConnectionsPanel.jsx:81-87`) requires `srefs.length === 1`, i.e. the panel must already be open against a single segment. The `lexicon.spec.ts` `beforeEach` clicks `Genesis 1:1` first so the trigger has the precondition it expects.
- `ToolsButton` instances carry a stable English-only `data-name` attribute (set from the `en` prop in `ConnectionsPanel.jsx:1106`). The page object uses that as the primary anchor — `pm.onResourcePanel().toolsButton('About this Text')` — rather than visible text, which differs by interface language.
- The reference text is **Genesis 1** for nearly every test. It is the most stable Sefaria URL: always available, has many connections, multiple translations, and a deterministic segment markup. `RP-040 → RP-047` uses `Psalms.23` for translation diversity.

---

## 5. Mode navigation map

The CSV describes target states ("TextList shows connection snippets for Rashi"). The panel's mode graph isn't documented anywhere else, so this table maps every mode to the click sequence that reaches it from the default Resources view. All `data-name` values are the English `en` prop of `<ToolsButton>` (stable across interface languages).

| To reach mode | Starting state | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resources (default) | Panel closed | `pm.onResourcePanel().clickSegment('<Ref>')` |
| About | Resources | click `data-name="About this Text"` (`pm.onResourcePanel().openAbout()`) |
| Navigation (TOC) | Resources | click `data-name="Table of Contents"` (`openTOC()`) |
| Translations | Resources | click `data-name="Translations"` (`openTranslations()`) |
| Translation Open | Translations | click `.versionBlock .versionPreview` (a version's title) — invokes `openVersionInSidebar` |
| SidebarSearch | Resources | click `data-name="Search in this Text"` |
| ConnectionsList for category X | Resources | click the `.categoryFilterGroup` / `.category` whose text starts with X |
| TextList for book Y | ConnectionsList | click the `.textFilter` (or `.textFilter.on`) for Y |
| Topics | Resources (only visible when count > 0) | click `data-name="Topics"` |
| WebPages | Resources | click `data-name="Web Pages"` |
| Manuscripts | Resources (only visible when manuscripts exist for ref) | click `data-name="Manuscripts"` |
| Notes | Resources (auth required — see §7) | click `data-name="Notes"` |
| Add To Sheet | Tools (auth required) | click `data-name="Add to Sheet"` |
| Share | Tools | click `data-name="Share"` |
| Feedback | Tools | click `data-name="Feedback"` |
| Advanced Tools | Tools | click `data-name="Advanced"` |
| Add Connection | Advanced Tools (auth required) | click "Add Connection" inside Advanced Tools |
| Lexicon (auto) | Resources, panel open for 1 segment | select 1–2 Hebrew words in the main reader (`selectHebrewWordInMainReader()`) |
| Lexicon (manual) | any | click `data-name="Dictionaries"` (`openLexiconManual()`) |
| Guide | Resources (only when guide content exists for ref) | click `data-name="Guided Learning"` |
| Back to previous mode | any sub-mode | click `pm.onResourcePanel().clickBack()` |

**Reverse navigation contract.** The back button is `.readerPanelBox.sidebar a.connectionsHeaderTitle.active`. Its target mode is determined by `ConnectionsPanelHeader.previousModes` (Translation Open → Translations, extended notes → Translations, WebPagesList → WebPages); for everything else it returns to Resources. The URL `?with=` param tracks the mode and is the most reliable signal that back actually moved.

## 6. Per-mode selector quick reference

Every mode has a stable container (its *mode anchor*, already mapped in `expectMode()` in the POM) and a stable per-item selector for assertions. Use the container to assert the mode is active; use the per-item selector to assert content has loaded (see [§8 Common gotchas](#8-common-gotchas) — the container often renders before items arrive).

| Mode | Mode anchor (container) | Per-item selector | Click outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resources | `.topToolsButtons` | `.toolsButton[data-name="…"]` | switches to sub-mode |
| About | `.aboutBox` | `.aboutTitle`, `.aboutAuthor a`, `.versionExtendedNotesLinks` | author link → topic page; Extended Notes → extended-notes mode |
| Translations | `.translationsHeader, .translationsBox, .versionsBox` | `.language-block`, `.versionBlock` | title → Translation Open; `.selectButton` → main reader version change |
| Translation Open | back-button to Translations visible | `.textRange[data-ref]` | navigate main reader |
| Navigation (TOC) | `.textTableOfContents, .tocContent` | section `<a>` links | main reader jumps to section |
| ConnectionsList | `.categoryFilterGroup, .category, .textFilter` | `.textFilter` (a book) | enter TextList for that book |
| TextList | `.textListTextRangeBox` | `.textRange[data-ref]` | main reader navigates to that ref |
| Topics | `.topicList` | `.topicButton[id^="topicItem-"]` (`target="_blank"`) | opens topic in new tab |
| WebPages | `.webpageList` | `.website[role="button"]` (site-level), then `.webpageList a` (page-level) | site → filter pages; page → external new tab |
| Manuscripts | `.manuscriptList, .manuscriptImage` | `.manuscriptImage` | full-resolution image in new tab |
| Notes | `.addNoteBox` | `.noteText` (textarea), `.myNoteList .note` | save / edit / delete |
| Add To Sheet | `.addToSourceSheetBox, .sourceSheetSelector` | sheet autocomplete suggestions | adds source to sheet |
| Share | `.shareBox, #sheetShareLink` | `#sheetShareLink` (URL input), `.copyLinkIcon` | copy to clipboard or external new tab |
| Feedback | `.feedbackBox, textarea[placeholder*="Feedback"i]` | form fields | submits feedback |
| Advanced Tools | `.advancedToolsList, .toolButtonsList` | "Add Translation" / "Add Connection" / "Edit Text" | navigates to editor |
| Add Connection | `.addConnectionBox` | type dropdown, ref input | creates connection on save |
| SidebarSearch | `.sidebarSearch, .sidebarSearchInput` | search input + result rows | jumps main reader to result |
| Lexicon | `.lexicon-content, .lexicon-instructions` | `.entry`, `.headword`, `.named-entity-wrapper` | none (display only) |
| Guide | `.guideBox, .keyQuestions` | key question / summary / commentary rows | walks the user through Q → A → commentary |

**When in doubt, read the React component.** All these selectors come from `static/js/ConnectionsPanel.jsx` (and its child components in the same directory) — verify against the source if the test starts misbehaving after a Sefaria release.

## 7. Auth-gated panel features

Several panel modes silently change behavior when the user is logged out. Tests for these features must enter via `goToPageWithUser(context, url, BROWSER_SETTINGS.enUser)` (or `.enAdmin` for moderator-only features) — otherwise the test sees the sign-up modal and fails for the wrong reason.

| Feature | Logged-in requirement | Logged-out behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notes (RP-120 → RP-125) | Any user (`BROWSER_SETTINGS.enUser`) | Sign-up modal opens; no notes UI visible. RP-120 verifies this prompt explicitly. |
| Add to Sheet (RP-130 → RP-133) | Any user | Sign-up modal opens. RP-130 verifies the prompt. |
| Add Connection (RP-140 → RP-144) | Editor / moderator (`BROWSER_SETTINGS.enAdmin`) | Sign-up modal opens. RP-140 verifies the prompt. |
| Advanced Tools — Edit Text (RP-171, RP-173) | Editor permissions | Button hidden entirely; RP-173 verifies non-editors don't see it. |
| Topics — "Create topic" inline option (RP-083) | Moderator (`BROWSER_SETTINGS.enAdmin`) | Hidden. |
| Web Pages — moderator-only items | Moderator | Some items render only when `Sefaria.is_moderator === true`. |
| Everything else (Resources, About, Translations, TOC, Lexicon, Share, Feedback, ConnectionsList, TextList, Topics, WebPages, Manuscripts, Sheets, SidebarSearch, Guide) | None | Renders normally for logged-out users. |

`BROWSER_SETTINGS.enLAUser` is *not* a substitute for `.english` here — that account is whitelisted for the Library Assistant, not for general write features.

## 8. Common gotchas

Three traps that bit us in Part 1 and will bite Part 2 if not documented.

### 8.1 Mode anchor ≠ data loaded

Most panel modes render their wrapper container synchronously and stream their content in async. `expectMode('Translations')` returns the moment `.versionsBox` is in the DOM — which happens *before* `Sefaria.getAllTranslationsWithText` resolves. If your assertion is on per-version data, you must wait for the inner element:

```ts
// ❌ Flaky — `.versionsBox` is visible immediately, even during loading.
await pm.onResourcePanel().openTranslations();
const headers = await page.locator('.connectionsPanel .language-block .versionLanguage').allInnerTexts();
// headers is often [] here.

// ✅ Reliable — wait for the actual data-bearing child first.
await pm.onResourcePanel().openTranslations();
await expect(page.locator('.connectionsPanel .language-block').first()).toBeVisible({ timeout: t(20000) });
const headers = await page.locator('.connectionsPanel .language-block .versionLanguage').allInnerTexts();
```

The POM's `getLanguageBlockHeaders()` already does this. When adding new helpers that read async-loaded content, follow the same pattern.

### 8.2 URL coupling — the panel mirrors its state to URL params

The connections panel writes its state to the page URL:

- `?with=<Mode>` — current mode (`Resources`, `About`, `Translations`, `Lexicon`, `WebPages`, `ConnectionsList`, …)
- `?lookup=<word>` — selectedWords (set when a Hebrew word is selected)
- `?lookup=&with=…` style — when state is partially cleared

This is your friend for assertions: after an action that should change state, assert on the URL rather than DOM hopes. After a deselect, `?lookup=` should drop; after back-from-About, `?with=` should become `all` or disappear; after opening a version, `?ven=` or `?vhe=` should appear.

It's also a debug shortcut: when a test fails, *look at the URL in the trace*. A stuck `lookup=` after a deselect means React state didn't clear (see RP-057 for the workaround).

### 8.3 Auto-mode-switching in `ConnectionsPanel.componentDidUpdate`

The panel reacts to its own props in two ways that can surprise tests:

1. **`selectedWords` set + `srefs.length === 1` → mode auto-flips to `Lexicon`.** Tests for non-lexicon flows must keep selectedWords empty; if your test selects text for any reason (debugging, accidental drag), the panel jumps to Lexicon and breaks downstream assertions.
2. **`selectedWords` cleared while `prevProps.mode === "Lexicon"` → mode auto-flips back to `Resources`.** This is what RP-057 exercises. The transition only fires if mode was actually `Lexicon` in the previous render — clearing selectedWords from any other mode does nothing.

When writing new tests, if you don't intend to test the lexicon, don't trigger selections.

### 8.4 Single-panel vs multi-panel layout

`ReaderApp.jsx` chooses between single-panel and multi-panel layout based on viewport. At desktop widths (Playwright's default) it's multi-panel, and our selectors rely on `.readerPanelBox.sidebar` existing. If a test sets `viewport: { width: <760 }` or similar, the panel collapses to single-panel (`fullPanel=false`, no sidebar class) and most selectors break.

Don't change viewport size in Resource Panel tests unless you're explicitly testing responsive behavior, and if you do, document the layout assumption.

### 8.5 Auth-gated buttons don't enter a panel mode when logged out

The Tools buttons for `Notes` / `Add to Sheet` / `Add Connection` use this onClick:

```js
() => !Sefaria._uid ? toggleSignUpModal(SignUpModalKind.Notes) : setConnectionsMode("Notes")
```

When logged out the click renders the **SignUpModal** (`#interruptingMessageBox.sefariaModalBox`) — the panel does NOT switch to Notes mode. So calling `openNotes()` (which waits for the `.addNoteBox` mode anchor) hangs forever. Pattern for logged-out auth-gated tests:

```ts
await pm.onResourcePanel().toolsButton('Notes').click();
await expect(page.locator('#interruptingMessageBox.sefariaModalBox').first()).toBeVisible();
```

### 8.6 FA icon `<i>` elements have zero intrinsic dimensions

Sefaria's `Note.editNoteButton` renders as `<i class="editNoteButton fa fa-pencil">` with no text content. Font Awesome paints the icon via a CSS `::before` pseudo-element. Playwright's actionability check measures the `<i>`'s box — which is `0 × 0` — and refuses to click. The fix:

```ts
await note.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();
await note.locator('.editNoteButton').click({ force: true });
```

Same applies to any other Sefaria element where the visual is pseudo-element-rendered.

### 8.7 jQuery `$.post` urlencodes spaces as `+`, not `%20`

Sefaria's API calls go through jQuery. When you intercept a body and `decodeURIComponent` it, spaces appear as literal `+`. Normalize before substring-matching:

```ts
const decoded = decodeURIComponent(body).replace(/\+/g, ' ');
expect(decoded).toContain('Genesis 1:1');  // not 'Genesis+1:1'
```

Also note: `decodeURIComponent` throws "URI malformed" when the body has stray special characters mixed with `%XX` sequences (e.g. user-typed `<`, `>`). For feedback / note bodies, skip the decode and substring-match the raw urlencoded body, or use `.replace(/\+/g, ' ')` alone.

### 8.8 Network interception is non-negotiable for destructive APIs

The auth-gated tests (Notes, Add to Sheet, Feedback) MUST intercept the relevant endpoints so we don't accumulate state on the QA user / Sefaria backend:

| Test | Endpoint to intercept |
| --- | --- |
| RP-121 / RP-122 / RP-123 (Notes) | None — tests create + delete in the same test (real notes, cleaned up by test logic) |
| RP-131 / RP-132 (Add to Sheet) | `**/api/sheets/**/add` |
| RP-161 (Feedback) | `**/api/send_feedback` |

Interception pattern:

```ts
let body: string | null = null;
await page.route('**/api/sheets/**/add', async (route) => {
  body = route.request().postData();
  await route.fulfill({ status: 200, contentType: 'application/json', body: JSON.stringify({ id: 999999, sources: [], status: 'ok' }) });
});
// ... trigger the action ...
expect(body).toBeTruthy();
// substring-match the captured payload
```

### 8.9 Confirm dialogs need a listener BEFORE the click

`AddNoteBox.deleteNote` calls `window.confirm()`. Register the dialog handler before clicking delete:

```ts
this.page.once('dialog', d => d.accept().catch(() => {}));
await deleteButton.click();
```

If you reverse the order, the dialog auto-dismisses with cancel and the delete silently no-ops.

### 8.10 Different web-page data lives in different APIs

`/api/related/<Ref>` returns sheets, topics, links, manuscripts — but **not** web pages. Web pages live at `/api/related/<Ref>/websites`. When researching whether a reference text has web pages for RP-090-style tests, hit the correct endpoint.

### 8.11 Recent filter chips live INSIDE the TextList view, not the panel header

`RecentFilterSet` is rendered inside the TextList view (`TextList.jsx:188`), not in the connections-panel header. After navigating ConnectionsList → TextList(Rashi) → back → TextList(Ibn Ezra), the chips show in `.connectionsPanel .recentFilterSet .textFilter` *while you're in TextList*. If your test clicks back to ConnectionsList, the chips disappear — assert them while still in TextList.

### 8.12 Hebrew interface RTL applies to the app shell, not English content panels

`interface-hebrew` body class sets `direction: rtl` on `body` and `.readerApp`. The `.connectionsPanel` inside a `.readerPanel.english` wrapper inherits LTR (English content panel). For RP-210, assert on the body/app direction, not the panel:

```ts
expect(await page.locator('body').evaluate(el => getComputedStyle(el).direction)).toBe('rtl');
```

### 8.13 Connection snippet text body isn't the navigation target

Clicking a snippet's TEXT in TextList does nothing — only internal `.refLink` citations within the text fire `onCitationClick`. The "Open" affordance is the `.connection-button.panel-open-link` button in `.connection-buttons`. For tests that want the main reader to navigate, click that explicitly.

## 9. Adding a new Resource Panel test

1. **Pick the spec file** that matches the feature area, or create a new `kebab-case.spec.ts` if the area doesn't fit.
2. **Reuse the POM.** Almost everything you need is on `pm.onResourcePanel()` — see [`pages/resourcePanelPage.ts`](../../pages/resourcePanelPage.ts). Add new methods there rather than putting raw locators in the spec.
3. **Scope correctly.** Main-reader locators must use `.readerPanelBox:not(.sidebar)`; panel-header locators must use `.readerPanelBox.sidebar .connectionsPanelHeader`; panel-body locators can use `.connectionsPanel.textList` directly.
4. **Mode anchors.** Use `pm.onResourcePanel().expectMode('X')` to assert the panel is in mode `X`. It already maps each mode to a stable child class (e.g. `.aboutBox`, `.translationsBox`, `.lexicon-content`, `.textTableOfContents`). For per-item assertions, wait for the specific child element after the mode anchor passes — see [§8.1](#81-mode-anchor--data-loaded).
5. **Timeouts.** Always wrap with `t()` from [`globals.ts`](../../globals.ts). Lexicon and Translations panels load asynchronously — `t(15000)` is a good default for their mode anchors, `t(20000)` for inner data.
6. **Don't skip for missing data.** Per CLAUDE.md rule 12, `test.skip` is reserved for harness limitations, not environment data gaps. If a feature surface appears empty: verify via the Sefaria API (CLAUDE.md §2A), pick a different reference text, or convert to a structural assertion (see how RP-034/RP-047 handle the empty-`extendedNotes` case).
7. **Check auth-gating.** If your feature is in [§7](#7-auth-gated-panel-features), use `goToPageWithUser` instead of `goToPageWithLang`.
