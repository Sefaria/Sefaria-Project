# Trilingual Display - Issue Tracker

## Critical Issues (Blocking Alpha Release)

### üîß Issue #1: Column Width Algorithm Needs Refinement
**Status**: High Priority  
**Component**: Layout Engine  
**Description**: The current proportional column sizing algorithm works but needs refinement for edge cases and better responsiveness.

**Current Behavior**:
- Algorithm calculates proportions based on content width
- Works well for typical verses (7-15 words)
- Uses 97% of viewport width effectively

**Problems**:
- Very short verses (1-3 words) get disproportionately wide columns
- Very long verses (30+ words) may cause overflow on small screens
- Viewport resize handling needs optimization
- Column gaps could be more intelligent

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add min/max column width constraints
- Implement intelligent breakpoints for different content lengths
- Better responsive behavior with CSS media queries integration
- Smart column gap calculation based on content density

### ‚ö° Issue #2: Performance Optimization Required
**Status**: High Priority  
**Component**: Word Packing Algorithm  
**Description**: Current implementation recalculates text measurements and line distributions multiple times per verse.

**Performance Concerns**:
- Canvas text measurement called repeatedly
- Word-packing algorithm tests multiple line count scenarios
- DOM manipulation not batched efficiently

**Proposed Solutions**:
- Implement text measurement caching
- Optimize word-packing with dynamic programming approach
- Batch DOM updates
- Consider Web Workers for heavy calculations

### üì± Issue #3: Cross-Browser and Mobile Compatibility
**Status**: High Priority  
**Component**: Browser Support  
**Description**: Currently only tested on Chromium browsers. Safari, Firefox, and mobile compatibility unknown.

**Missing Support**:
- Safari font rendering differences
- Firefox flexbox behavior variations  
- Mobile responsive design
- Touch interaction support
- iOS/Android browser quirks

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### üîå Issue #4: Sefaria Core Integration
**Status**: Medium Priority  
**Component**: Integration  
**Description**: Current implementation is standalone. Needs integration with Sefaria's core systems.

**Integration Points**:
- User authentication and preferences
- Text navigation and routing
- Search functionality integration
- Bookmarking and annotations support

---

### ‚ôø Issue #5: Accessibility Compliance
**Status**: Medium Priority  
**Component**: Accessibility  
**Description**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and WCAG compliance not implemented.

**Missing Features**:
- ARIA labels for trilingual content
- Keyboard navigation between columns
- Screen reader optimization for Hebrew/transliteration flow
- High contrast mode support
- Font size accessibility controls

---

### üåê Issue #6: API Error Handling
**Status**: Medium Priority  
**Component**: Network Layer  
**Description**: Better error handling and user feedback for API failures needed.

**Current Issues**:
- Silent fallback to hardcoded content
- No user notification of API failures
- No retry mechanisms
- Poor offline experience

---

## Low Priority Issues

### üé® Issue #7: UI Polish and User Experience
**Status**: Low Priority  
**Component**: UI/UX  
**Description**: Visual refinements and user experience improvements.

**Wishlist**:
- Loading animations
- Smooth transitions between texts
- Better print preview
- Dark mode support
- Custom font selection

---

### üìä Issue #8: Analytics and Monitoring
**Status**: Low Priority  
**Component**: Analytics  
**Description**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring for trilingual display.

**Features**:
- User interaction tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error reporting integration
- A/B testing framework for algorithm improvements

## Development Notes

**Algorithm Status**: Core trilingual balance algorithm is working correctly. The line balance issue has been resolved - Hebrew/transliteration and English now maintain equal line counts per verse.

**Next Steps**: Focus on column width algorithm refinement and cross-browser testing before moving to Alpha status.
