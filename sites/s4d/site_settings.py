It contains an initial set of example texts, for which we are seeking a partner organization to build into a complete library. This library is not interconnected with Sefaria's library of Jewish texts. <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vREoqWlYLC68jScm2yBO2cZY1SbLOjj67Tu59VdVVYf1lbnNIxiKG07GSNKlg6p77kIpauiqPRZsSsk/pub'>Learn More â€º</a>"
