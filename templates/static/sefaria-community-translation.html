                Sefaria Community Translations are crowd-sourced translations which can be done on any work
                in the Sefaria database.
                These crowd-sourced translations are ongoing and open to contribution,
                so if you see an improvement that you think should be made - make it!
                In time we hope that the wisdom of the crowds will help create a high quality free
                translation which can be used by all.
