                    <h3>What is Pecha.org?</h3> 
                    For centuries, Buddhist wisdom has been preserved in sacred scriptures—written in Tibetan, Sanskrit, Chinese, and now, increasingly, in English. From palm-leaf manuscripts to modern publications, each era has found new ways to protect and share the Dharma. Pecha.org continues this lineage by building a digital future for Buddhist texts.
                    Pecha.org is a nonprofit initiative committed to making Buddhist scriptures accessible, searchable, and adaptable for all. Hosting canonical texts from the Kangyur and Tengyur to the Vinaya, Sutras, Tantras, and commentaries, Pecha.org provides multilingual access across Tibetan, English, and Chinese. Inspired by the structure of Sefaria, it goes further to serve the unique needs of Buddhist scholarship and practice.
                    Through a combination of user tools, open-source infrastructure, and a growing digital library, Pecha.org empowers scholars, practitioners, and developers to engage deeply with Buddhist teachings in today’s digital world.
                    
                    <h3>Pecha.org’s Vision</h3>
                    <h4>Access</h4>
                    Pecha.org believes Buddhist teachings are a shared human treasure. The platform makes canonical and commentarial texts openly accessible for study, reflection, and creative reuse. Whether you are printing a source sheet, creating a translation project, or exploring teachings in your native language, the content is freely available to all.
                    <h4>Infrastructure</h4>
                    The platform provides a rich technical foundation. With open-source code and robust APIs, developers can integrate Pecha's data into NLP pipelines, dictionary tools, or AI-based research. Structured formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and annotation frameworks from the OpenPecha initiative offer powerful ways to build new applications on top of the core texts.
                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    More than a library, Pecha.org is a learning platform. Users can build personalized collections, annotate texts, and create structured “source sheets” for classes or Dharma talks. These tools help educators and students bring Buddhist teachings to life in classrooms, monasteries, and online learning environments.
                    <h4>Conversation</h4>
                    Buddhist wisdom has long been a living dialogue—between teacher and student, across generations of commentary, and now, among digital communities. Pecha.org fosters this ongoing conversation by supporting collaborative tools, community curation, and open sharing through GitHub and social media.
