<p><b>About Sefaria:</b> Sefaria is building the open, online, living library of Jewish texts that will establish the digital infrastructure for the future of Jewish study, education, and knowledge. Best-selling author Joshua Foer (“Moonwalking with Einstein”) and Brett Lockspeiser, leader of the Google team that developed the Google News Archive, co-founded Sefaria in 2013.</p>

<p>Sefaria is committed to making Jewish literature accessible and evolvable. We believe that Judaism’s remarkable textual tradition should be as easy to access as everything else online. Sefaria wants to make Jewish texts easy to find — both in the original format and in translation — and free, presented with a user interface that is elegant, intuitive and interactive. Beyond access, having a database of Jewish texts in a structured, digital format opens up new possibilities for creativity and study. For example, check out our <a href="/explore">interactive visualization of textual connections</a>.</p>

<h2 id="content-engineer" class="anchorable">Content Engineer</h2>

<p>Sefaria is looking for a junior programmer to work on importing new texts into our database. The role involves writing scripts to parse text and data files and requires familiarity with traditional Jewish texts in Hebrew and Aramaic.</p>

<h3>About the Role</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sefaria is building an online library of Jewish texts. We have people who OCR old books from which we need to get the digital text into our database. The process of parsing the unstructured digital text and posting them to Sefaria's database generally involves writing a small custom script which understands the structure to be extracted and translates it into JSON for posting.</li>
  <li>One of the tricky pieces is that many commentaries need to be done in such a way that they connect properly to the books that they're commenting on. For example if there is a commentary on Torah, the book needs to be structured in such a way that each comment is linked to the underlying sentence in the Torah that is being commented on.</li>
  <li>To facilitate this we have an <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/developers">API</a> which can be used to upload books to the website. We also have lots of code from <a href="https://github.com/blockspeiser/Sefaria-Data/tree/master/sources">previous projects</a> that has been used to upload various works. Most of our code is in Python, however you are not limited to Python if you prefer another language. Right now we have more projects than we can handle so we'd like to have someone we can turn to who will help us with the overload. Given that we want to increase our OCR speed in the coming months, we'll probably have a steady stream of projects going forward.</li>
  <li>To do this job, you will need to understand the texts you're working with so you can make judgment calls on what should go where, or how different text sections should be broken up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taking the OCRed text of a stand-alone book and having it automatically posted to the website.</li>
<li>Taking a commentary on a masechet of Talmud which has been 'tagged' (things like the dibur hamatchil and daf number have been marked), and uploading it to the website. You'll have to figure out where to make connections between the commentary and the underlying text.</li>
<li>Taking the XML output of another program, processing the XML, and uploading it as a JSON object to our website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Terms</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Contract based to start (hourly) with the opportunity to grow into a full time position.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Location</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remote OK, with a preference for Jerusalem/Israel.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Contact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:ari@sefaria.org">ari@sefaria.org</a></li>
