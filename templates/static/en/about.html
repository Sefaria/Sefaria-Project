                    For thousands of years, our culture, our traditions, and our values have been transmitted through our texts.
                    From an oral tradition to handwritten scrolls to a vast corpus of printed books, each new medium democratized knowledge,
                    and brought more people into the great Jewish conversation.
                    We are the generation charged with shepherding our texts from print to digital in a way that can expand their reach
                    and impact in new and unprecedented ways.

                    We are assembling a free living library of Jewish texts and their interconnections,
                    in Hebrew and in translation.
                    With these digital texts, we can create new, interactive interfaces for Web, tablet and mobile,
                    allowing more people to engage with the textual treasures of our tradition.
