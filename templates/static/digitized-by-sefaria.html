<h2> Texts Digitized by Sefaria</h2>
    <p>For the Jewish people, our texts are our collective treasure. They belong to everyone and we want them to be available to everyone, to use in any manner. Sefaria tries to provide only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> or freely licensed works. Sefaria digitizes many older books whose copyrights have expired and provides the text to the public, for free, with no use restrictions whatsoever. This is just one of the ways that Sefaria is trying to contribute to the public good – by digitizing these works and allowing anyone to use them.</p>

    <p>To date, the following works have been digitized by Sefaria and are included in our system. You are welcome to copy, share, print, sell, or adapt these works as you see fit. Source files for digitization may be available on request.</p>
