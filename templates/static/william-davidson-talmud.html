            <p><a href="/texts/Talmud">The William Davidson Talmud</a> is a free digital edition of the Babylonian Talmud with parallel translations, interlinked to major commentaries, biblical citations, Midrash, Halakhah, and an ever-growing library of Jewish texts. As with all of Sefaria, The William Davidson Talmud will continually evolve as we add additional translations, commentaries, and connections.</p>
            <p>It will ultimately include Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz Even-Israel’s complete Modern Hebrew and English translations of the Talmud. Through the generous support of The William Davidson Foundation, these translations are now available with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank">Creative Commons non-commercial license</a>, making them free for use and re-use &mdash; even beyond Sefaria.</p>

        <h2>William Davidson</h2>
        <div id="davidsonDates">December 5, 1922 - March 13, 2009</div>

        <p>William Davidson was an internationally recognized businessman and lifelong philanthropist who cherished above all else his family and his Jewish heritage. Throughout his life, he supported projects and organizations that preserved and enhanced Jewish life and continuity. From his parents he learned that success in business provides the means for helping others. This family philosophy shaped his life.</p>
         
        <p>An expert in making troubled companies profitable, he transformed a struggling, family-owned automotive-glass fabricating firm into one of the world’s largest manufacturers of architectural and automotive glass. He also was the owner of several professional sports teams, including the Detroit Pistons basketball team. A native of Detroit, Michigan, he earned his bachelor of business degree from the University of Michigan and his law degree from Wayne State University.</p>
         
        <p>In 2005, he established the William Davidson Foundation, a private, family foundation to advance for future generations the economic, cultural and civic vitality of Southeast Michigan, the State of Israel and the Jewish community. “One of the secrets to a fulfilling life,” he once said, “is to be able to do things for other people.”  To commemorate his life and extend his spirit of generosity, the Talmud, as translated in English and Modern Hebrew by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, is now accessible to all.</p>
